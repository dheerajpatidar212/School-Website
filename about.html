                should be child-centered, therefore, SPCS is providing such a constructive environment which is
                indispensable
                for overall development of children.</p>


            <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1mTjVekJwhdIVP4iGMfFc4O1aHNJ6-pSV" class="img2">Today, the world has become a global village. Hence, globalization of culture, commerce and trade politics
                has
                become a reality. Therefore schools must provide infrastructure and environment not merely for information
                and
                knowledge, but for the Education of the children so as to enable them to face the ramifications of
                globalization. SPCS, being thoroughly aware of it, is providing an environment where children acquire global
                perspective through introduction to various cultures, civilization and religion of the world.In our school,
                children are encouraged to give reign to their fancy and imagination without any restriction for further
                exploration. The mere desire and inclination to think new thoughts, to invent and to discover are adding a
                completely new dimension to the process of learning.We have got inhouse training programmes for teachers and
                also sending teachers to outside training courses organized by both CBSE and other organizations to
                incorporate
                skills, competencies and values with knowledge.</p><br><br>
